# iw4x-overridespawns
GSC script to override/add spawns to maps

Originally made for SP maps with weird spawns, but can be used with any map ^^

You can either install the latest [release](https://github.com/Bluscream/iw4x-overridespawns/releases) or [download the repository as zip file](https://github.com/Bluscream/iw4x-overridespawns/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the scripts/ folder to your <game>/userraw/ folder.
